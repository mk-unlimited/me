   <title>LPI and Examples</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;low-purchase-intent-lpi-search-terms&quot;&gt;Low Purchase Intent (LPI) Search Terms&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative keywords are words and phrases that you do not want searchers to associate with your products and services (see Google Ads blog for some high-level information about negative keywords). When you add negative keywords to your PPC campaigns your ads will not be served if those words are part of the user’s search query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-would-this-be-important-&quot;&gt;Why would this be important ?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Purchase Intent Search Terms are keywords that do not work with a specific industry or brand. The reason this listing words that are negative and do not works is because it gets rid of the majority of this “low purchase intent” (LPI) searches — searches for terms that are conceptually related to your root keyword, but have little or no drive to actually buy your insurance product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These LPI searches can be confusing — many of them may actually increase CTR because of their informational nature (people are more likely to click the first ad they see if they’re just hunting for data), but they’ll almost always decrease the one thing you really care about: your conversion rate. My advice? Get rid of them as soon as possible to decrease ad spend. Clicks don’t make you money. Conversions do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 301 negative keywords for your insurance company’s Google Ads campaign from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nicksaraev/insurance-company-google-ads-the-301-best-negative-keywords-for-your-insurance-company-google-ads-4e0aa3f01fe5&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another example if your looking to remove bargain hunter for clicking your ads. Which will cost you money. These negative keywords will help if you are positioned as a premium provider. If you do want visitors for these keyword concepts, create an additional campaign or ad group to focus on these discount concepts, and specifically bid on keywords that contain these words. And then make sure to add this list of negative keywords to the campaigns or ad groups that do not target the discount audience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;bargain&quot;

&quot;cheap&quot;

&quot;clearance&quot;

&quot;close out&quot;

&quot;close outs&quot;

&quot;inexpensive&quot;

&quot;liquidation&quot;

&quot;odd lots&quot;

&quot;overstock&quot;

&quot;remainder&quot;

&quot;remainders&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this method of looking what not to include rather than what to include may help you achieve better results in  your ppc ads.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Visuals for Google Ads ?</title>
   <link href="/me/2014/05/12/visuals-for-googleads"/>
   <updated>2014-05-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>/2014/05/12/visuals-for-googleads</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I start of with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krusecontrolinc.com/rule-of-7-how-social-media-crushes-old-school-marketing-2021/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that was done a while back that states you’ll come into contact with that prospect at least 7 times just to create interest or to be heard by the prospect. Not all touches are good, some may be bad or good. The point is that you’ll need to make the message meaningful and not regular sales talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With competitors like tiktok using more and more visuals that captures peoples attention in a short amount of time. Google is starting to make is products more visually appealing. Just take a look at what Google’s VP said in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. Since younger audiences tend to crave more visually rich content, it would be wise to incoporate visual elements in your advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;“In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search,” he continued. “They go to TikTok or Instagram.” - Google&apos;s VP
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventhough Google is looking to incoporate AR into it’s search function to enhance engagement. There are ways such as google ads display and youtube ads which help act as a supporting tool or a build up to that final purchase. That is where search ads becomes the final part of the process for your poe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Landmarks_Live_View.gif&quot; alt=&quot;google_live_view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to distribute content with rich in visual content as of 2022&lt;br /&gt;
Always use high quality images&lt;/p&gt;
