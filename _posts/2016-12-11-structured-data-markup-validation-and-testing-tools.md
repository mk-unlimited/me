The text that appears in an advertisement is known as “ad copy.”
Ad copy must be written in order to persuade the target audience to take the desired action.

There are a few key elements to keep in mind when writing ad copy:

# 1) Keep it brief and to the point

Ad viewers lose interest in ads that are too long. So, it is important to keep your ad copy short and to the point.

# 2) Be clear about your objective: 

The objective behind writing the ad copy must be clear to get the desired action from the potential audience.

# 3) Use persuasive language: 

Your ad copy should be persuasive and use language that will convince the reader to take the desired action.

# 4) Create a compelling message: 

Your message needs to be interesting and relevant to your target audience.

# 5) Including a Call-to-Action: 

Your ad copy should always include a call-to-action, informing the reader of what they should do next. Without a call-to-action, your ad will be ineffective.
Using words that brings up emotion 

If you keep these elements in mind, you can start writing good ad copy and start getting good results.
