# Low Purchase Intent (LPI) Search Terms 


Negative keywords are words and phrases that you do not want searchers to associate with your products and services (see Google Ads blog for some high-level information about negative keywords). When you add negative keywords to your PPC campaigns your ads will not be served if those words are part of the user’s search query.

# Why would this be important ?

Low Purchase Intent Search Terms are keywords that do not work with a specific industry or brand. The reason this listing words that are negative and do not works is because it gets rid of the majority of this “low purchase intent” (LPI) searches — searches for terms that are conceptually related to your root keyword, but have little or no drive to actually buy your insurance product or service.

These LPI searches can be confusing — many of them may actually increase CTR because of their informational nature (people are more likely to click the first ad they see if they’re just hunting for data), but they’ll almost always decrease the one thing you really care about: your conversion rate. My advice? Get rid of them as soon as possible to decrease ad spend. Clicks don’t make you money. Conversions do.

# Other Examples

Here is another example if your looking to remove bargain hunter for clicking your ads. Which will cost you money. These negative keywords will help if you are positioned as a premium provider. If you do want visitors for these keyword concepts, create an additional campaign or ad group to focus on these discount concepts, and specifically bid on keywords that contain these words. And then make sure to add this list of negative keywords to the campaigns or ad groups that do not target the discount audience:

```
"bargain"

"cheap"

"clearance"

"close out"

"close outs"

"closeout"

"closeouts"

"coupon"

"coupon code"

"discount"

"discounted"

"free"

"inexpensive"

"liquidation"

"odd lots"

"overstock"

"remainder"

"remainders"
```


Looking at this method of looking what not to include rather than what to include may help you achieve better results in  your ppc ads.
